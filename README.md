# hello-react-ts

This is a minimal ReactJS and TypeScript app structure.

Only a little over 110MB of `node_modules`.
It says a lot that this feels like some kind of victory.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. (optional) Run `npm run fmt` to auto-format the TypeScript code in src.

This should produce a `bundle.js` in the `dist` directory.
